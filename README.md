# Grid Carbon-Intensity Emulator

**Author:** Weilin  

An AI-powered system that predicts electricity grid carbon intensity and simulates the impact of energy policy changes across 167 countries.

---

## Overview

This project builds a machine learning emulator that instantly predicts a country's grid carbon intensity based on its power generation infrastructure. The trained model enables rapid simulation of policy scenarios—such as renewable energy transitions—without recalculating complex energy models.

**Key Achievement:** Trained XGBoost/Random Forest models achieve R² = 0.64 with MAE of 60 gCO2/kWh, enabling instant policy impact predictions.

**Features:**
- **Global Map**: Interactive choropleth showing carbon intensity across 167 countries
- **Policy Simulator**: Real-time "what-if" scenarios for energy transitions
- **Country Analysis**: Deep-dive into individual country energy profiles

## 📊 Data & Methodology

**Data Source:** [Global Power Plant Database](https://github.com/wri/global-power-plant-database) (World Resources Institute)
- 34,936 power plants worldwide
- Fuel types, capacity, and generation data

**Emission Factors:** Standard IPCC/EPA values (Coal: 820 gCO2/kWh, Gas: 490, Solar: 48, etc.)

## Key Results

### Model Performance
- **Algorithm:** Random Forest / XGBoost
- **R² Score:** 0.636
- **Mean Absolute Error:** 60 gCO2/kWh
- **Training Data:** 167 countries with complete energy mix data

### Sample Insights
- **Cleanest Grids:** Countries with 90%+ hydro/nuclear (e.g., Paraguay, Iceland)
- **Highest Emitters:** Coal-dependent grids (>800 gCO2/kWh)
- **Policy Impact:** Replacing 20% coal with solar reduces carbon intensity by 10-15%
